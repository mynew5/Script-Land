--[[Pusillin: "Do you want to play a game, stinky?"
<player>: "A Game? Are you crazy?"
Pusillin: "If you want the key, you'll have to catch me!"
Pusillin: "I hold the key to lands of free! Catch me and you'll see!"
<player>: "Why you little..."
Pusillin: "Chase me if you dare! I run without a care!"
Pusillin: "Still alive? You do surprise. Watch me as I flee!"
<player>: "Mark my words, I will catch you, imp. And when I do!"
Pusillin: "Why would you ever want to harm me!? Come. Friends we can be!"
Pusillin: "Turn that frown upside down!"
<player>: "DIE!"
Pusillin: "Die?! You make Pusillin cry!"
Pusillin: "This is the end of the line, no friend of mine!"
<player>: "Prepare to meet your maker."
Pusillin: "Say hello to my little friends!" (Scarface reference)
He still has these quotes, but he no longer is involved with any keys.
